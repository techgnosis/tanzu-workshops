What is a buildpack

Lets take a look at a buildpack. The first step will be to download a buildpack to the drive and take a look at it with an OCI image viewing tool.

The tool you will use is called `dive`. `dive` uses Docker under the hood to pull images, so the first step will be to login to the Tanzu Registry with docker.

Go ahead and do a `docker login registry.pivotal.io` and enter your credentials.
