# Environment Setup

Your workshop environment should already be setup for you. You are working inside a container with all the tools you might need included already. 

The following tools are included:
* `kp` CLI to work with Tanzu Build Service
* `kubectl` (aliased to `k`)
* `micro` text editor that is much easier to use than `vim`. I can't help you with `vim` questions
* `kapp`, `ytt`, and `kbld` are required to install Tanzu Build Service
* `dive` for exploring the contents of OCI images
