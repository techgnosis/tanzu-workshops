Your workshop environment is already setup for you. You are working inside a container with all the tools you need included.

## Pre-reqs
The only pre-requisite for this workshop is that you need a Tanzu Network account. You can sign-up for free at [Tanzu Network](https://network.pivotal.io)

## Included tools
The following tools are included:
* `kp` CLI to work with Tanzu Build Service
* `kubectl` (aliased to `k`)
* `micro` text editor that is much easier to use than `vim`. I can't help you with `vim` questions
* `kapp`, `ytt`, and `kbld` are required to install Tanzu Build Service
* `dive` for exploring the contents of OCI images

## Executable docs
All of the commands you will use in this workshop can be executed for you. Just click the icon at the top right of the command box. You can click to execute the same command as often as you want.
```execute
echo "I love executable documentation!"
```
